### Dashboard Analysis
Findings made using this dashboard are noted below:
- Roughly 2/3 of all sold and the most profitable items are accessories. Even though there were much more tires, tubes, bottles and cages sold, profit from helmets was the highest. While 4000 more units of bikes were sold, profit from bikes was much less than from clothing because of 180000$ loss on bikes in 2015. Jerseys and mountain bikes were by far the most profitable in the respectful categories. Jerseys were the most sold too, but road bikes were a bit more popular than mountain bikes. Overall, over a given period it is hard to observe any specific patterns of sales and it should be considered to change some prices to align high demand on some products with higher profit;
- US had the most products sold, but profit from clients in Germany was higher. Company lost money in 2015 primarily on the US market, so it shifted the overall situation. France and Germany had a huge demand from different territories. As a result, given information shows that Germany and US markets are soon to grow in sales and profit.
